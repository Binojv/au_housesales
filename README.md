# Advanced Regression Assignment:
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.

## General Information
- Project is executed using Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), Python and python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib,scikit-learn and seaborn to derive insights from the given dataset
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a dataset from the sale of houses in Australia which need to be analyzed.
- Building a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. This model will provide the management insights to how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
- The company has provided a dataset(CSV file) from the sale of houses in Australia which has 1460 rows and 81 columns

## Conclusions
- Highlighting the negative parameters will help the company make purchase houses below market value
- When making a sale, highlight the features that tend to fetch higher sale price  
- In a nutshell, Surprise Holding should keep a check on those predictors affecting the price of the house while making a buy or sell decision.
